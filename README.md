# What's this whole thing about?

I was reading a Wikipedia article about the Hippocratic Oath one day, and having read both the original version and the modern adaptations, I wanted to write something for programmers based on it. The translation of the original sounded so epic, so I based the text of the programmerâ€™s oath on that version.

There was also an article floating around about a year ago about the need for something like the Hippocratic oath for programmers, and I enjoyed reading the discussion about it on HackerNews - that was also the motivator to come up with something of my own.
